If you are not familiar with this, an explanation is available [here by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0) and another quick explanation is provided [in the post here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/689022/how-does-the-dot-product-determine-similarity).\n",

Notice below that the dot product where our 1 values overlap gives a value of 2 indicating higher similarity.  In the second dot product, the 1 values don't match up.
